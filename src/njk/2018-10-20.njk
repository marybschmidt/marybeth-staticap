    <p>Ishmael is a fictional character in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. Ishmael, the only surviving crewmember of the Pequod, is the narrator of the book. His importance relies on his role as narrator; as a character, he is only a minor participant in the action and the main protagonist is Captain Ahab.</p>
